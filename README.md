# Color-Picker
Android Application Development Term Project

Android application whose purpose is to allow the user to get a list of colors based on selected hue, saturation, and value components. The user chooses how many swatches (color examples) to be shown on each screen. After selecting the desired HSV values, a list of colors is shown that fits in the desired range. The list may be sorted by hue, saturation, or value. Clicking on a color from the list results in a toast that displays the HSV values for that specific color from the database. Additionally, the user can take a picture and find the dominant color in the picture, if it exists in the database, as well as colors that are close to it. The SQLite database contains 915 colors that were obtained from Wikipedia.
